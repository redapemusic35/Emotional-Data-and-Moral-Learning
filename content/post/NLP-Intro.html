<h2>Sources</h2>
<p>Some moral theorists recognize the prominence which emotions have for those actions which an individual, moral person, performs. For instance, David <span class="citation">Enoch (2014)</span> distinguishes between what he calls opaque evidence or reasons and transparent evidence / reasons (236). For instance, we might say someone’s reasons for acting, do not directly support the person’s action if the reason is an opaque reason. On the other hand, transparent evidence does directly support a particular action or belief. For an example of opaque reason, imagine a student who, upon taking a mathematics exam acts on her belief that a particular mathematical proposition is true. Further, lets say that her evidence supporting her belief that a particular proposition is true, is the fact that she was asked to solve this proposition when taking the mathematics exam. As such, her evidence that the proposition in question is true, is that she was asked to solve it (assuming that she would not be asked to solve a proposition that wasn’t true). As such, her evidence that the proposition is true is at best, opaque evidence <span class="citation">(this example is borrowed from McGrath 2019a, 89)</span>.</p>
<p>Enoch argues that acting for opaque reasons can be justifiable because similar to non-moral cases, the consequences possibly associated with making the wrong judgment are too great and therefore do not warrant the risk involved in deciding for one’s own self rather than deferring to another. This line of thought is counter to what others have argued <span class="citation">(e.g. see, Williams 1995)</span>. Where the disagreement has often existed, is in the area of moral deference often called moral testimony <span class="citation">(e.g. see, Hills 2009)</span>. What often amounts to the source of disagreement is that there are those who say that while it is acceptable to defer judgment to experts in non-moral cases, consider medical or engineering questions, it is not acceptable to defer judgment in moral cases.</p>
<p>Enoch argues that what is problematic about deferring judgment to experts in moral cases, is that those reasons which we ought to respond to in moral cases, in part concern the proper emotional responses that we expect in moral cases. As such, even though it is justifiable to defer judgment in moral cases because of the potential risk involved, doing so is not as admirable as deferring in non-moral cases. Enoch argues that this is because we miss the achievement that comes along with responding with the appropriate emotional response that moral cases demand <span class="citation">(see, Enoch 2014, 254)</span>. Therefore, while it is permissible to defer judgment in moral cases, deference in moral cases is still less admirable than judging appropriately without the need for deferring. This is because, in part, one misses out on exhibiting the proper kind of emotional response that we would argue is central to moral cases.</p>
<p>As such, when it comes to moral knowledge, I believe that it is prudent that we not only care about what a potential moral person knows, but we also care about how that person feels in a particular moral case. A part of the reasoning here refers to the potential importance one’s emotions may have in motivating or guiding her actions.</p>
<p>Analogously, Sarah McGrath defends a view similar to that defended by Enoch, that moral deference does contribute a great deal to one’s moral knowledge. A point in her argument is what she calls the <em>moral inheritance</em> view wherein we depend on others for our own moral knowledge, think of our observation of others moral behaviors, or reliance on their testimony in moral cases.</p>
<p>On this later point, narratives are important because they effect the way a subject feels in a hypothetical situation <span class="citation">(De Smedt and De Cruz 2015)</span>. On this point then, I treat song lyrics as a type of narrative, which I suggest can be in itself either a kind of testimony or point of observation for a potential moral agent. On this later point, I assume that <span class="citation">Stump (2010)</span>’s view that via narratives, we gain a second personal knowledge with the characters in the narrative, represents the observation of those same characters. What I mean by this, is that if Stump is right, that narratives acquaint us with those persons in the story, what she calls <em>knowledge by acquaintance</em>, then narratives possibly amount to kind of observation of persons. If narrative forms, then, include music lyrics, then those narratives introduced by the lyrics in music, are a kind of observation of those characters in the music. Lastly, assuming that McGrath is right, that much of our moral knowledge is facilitated by observation and testimony, then it does not seem that difficult to see how music lyrics can contribute to one’s moral knowledge. Further, if another point pushed by McGrath is true, that in all the same ways in which moral knowledge can be achieved, it can also be undermined, then it also seems true that if music lyrics contribute to moral knowledge, they can also undermine moral knowledge.</p>
<p>I then address the question of whether or not we can identify points in which the audience of a given narrative, might be morally influenced one way or the other by music narratives as a kind of testimony or observation.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Further, looking at literature in the philosophy
of emotions, particularly at the phenomenons of
emotional expression and emotional contagion, I believe
that a case can be made which shows just how
this might work, that narratives are a source
of moral knowledge.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>What makes my project unique I believe, is that I will attempt to combine various emerging methods of language analysis. Particularly:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Natural Language Processing</li>
<li>Topic Modeling</li>
</ol>
<p>and</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sentiment Analysis</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, I do not think that I will have reached any definitive conclusions regarding moral sources and music lyrics. What I hope to have done however, is offer some reflections on how we might use big data to determine which narratives contribute to moral knowledge and which ones undermine or take away from moral our moral knowledge. Baring that I fail in this aim, suggest additional questions in our search for moral knowledge.</p>

<div id="moral-knowledge" class="section level1">
<h1>Moral Knowledge</h1>
<p>In her book “Moral Knowledge,” Sarah <span class="citation">McGrath (2019b)</span> defends a view which she calls <em>The Moral Inheritance View</em>. According to the moral inheritance view, (miv) “by the time the typical moral agent begins to engage in reasoning that recognizably approximates the method of reflective equilibrium, she already has substantial moral knowledge” <span class="citation">(McGrath 2019b, 59)</span>. Reflective Equilibrium, RE, is the process by which an individual develops a set of principles, in our case these are moral principles, by which to live by. Additionally, the moral individual also develops a set of judgments by which she uses to justify her acceptance of these principles <span class="citation">(McGrath 2019b, 13)</span>. Her rejection of RE then, hinges on the idea that many of the principles and judgments that we use to justify those principles are developed before we are capable of even knowing what those principles and judgments are. As such, most of our moral knowledge does not come from moral reasoning whereby we are able to, or have already, or typically attempt to identify all of our moral judgments and formulate rules or principles which account for these judgments <span class="citation">(McGrath 2019b, 13)</span>. Further, while one might think that this is true of children, it is no longer true of adults, consider the kinds of judgments we might make in non-moral cases. For instance, in terms of deciding which medicine to take for some particular pain, we often defer to what we consider are experts, your pharmacist for example. As such, we do not think that it is problematic to rely on another’s testimony in non-moral cases whether we are children or adults.</p>
<p>If we develop our moral judgments prior to a time that we are capable of reflecting on those judgments, then from where do these come from? An overarching premise in McGrath’s book is that our moral judgments, just like our non-moral judgments, and principles come from other agents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One obvious possibility is this: in the usual case, the fact that a person will have at least some substantial moral knowledge by the time she is in a position to engage in anything like reflective equilibrium reasoning is guaranteed by the fact that she will have absorbed some such knowledge from her social environment <span class="citation">(McGrath 2019b, 59)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the sources for moral knowledge then? While they can include reflection, and reflective equilibrium, it does not seem that this is how the majority of them are developed. That leaves observation, inference, and possibly perception, but most importantly it leaves other people. As such, other people are the largest contributing factor to our moral knowledge.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<div id="our-dependence-on-others" class="section level2">
<h2>Our Dependence on Others</h2>
<p>On McGrath’s vision of moral knowledge then, moral knowledge is analogous to general knowledge. “Let’s begin by noting that, if in fact we arrive at moral knowledge in all the ways that we arrive at non-moral knowledge, this provides some reason to think that the Moral Inheritance View is true” <span class="citation">(McGrath 2019b, 60)</span>. How does general knowledge work? How do we come to have it? By others.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> As such, McGrath thinks that regardless of our “age or intellect,” we depend on others for most of what we know about the world <span class="citation">(McGrath 2019b, 60)</span>. An example would be our trust in the expertise of the medical community. As such, if our beliefs come from sources that are thought reliable by members of a particular community, then we often consider that these beliefs count as knowledge. Whether this kind of knowledge getting is only unique to non-moral knowledge has long been a divisive question. However, McGrath argues that we can think of others as a source for moral knowledge in the same way that we do for non-moral knowledge.</p>
<p>Although I am not sure how confident I am on what I hope to show, my question hinges on the idea that it is possible to use data analysis to discover what contributes to our moral knowledge and what my take away from it.</p>
<p>In the following sections, I will explain the methods that I used to source and clean the data that I will be using for my moral knowledge and natural language processing proof of concept.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Noel <span class="citation">Carroll (2010)</span> addresses an analogous question with fictional narratives in art, film, and literature. He argues that the emotive and other affective responses of “readers, viewers, and listeners” converge and resonate with the emotional states that the narrative attributes to the characters of that narrative. If he is right, then I think that this also has implications for how listeners identify with characters as they are portrayed in a song’s lyrics.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>In his “Empathy and Moral Development,” Martin <span class="citation">Hoffman (2000)</span> defends a theory which “attempts to account for human action in five types of moral encounters or dilemmas” (3) According to this view, these five human action types share the same “empathic motive base” (4) where he defines empathy as “an affective response more appropriate to another’s situation than one’s own” (4).<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
