hurt to see another nigga bondin&#39; with her\nCan&#39;t even look you in your eyes &#39;cause I&#39;m burnin&#39; up with guilt\nFor that one moment, went too far, and now I fucked up what we built\n\nGirl, you got me losin&#39; my mind\nI just want you to see that I&#39;m trying\nEver since you left, the sun don&#39;t shine\nDon&#39;t want to lose you in this race against time\nHypnotized by your love, I&#39;m blind\nIt&#39;s so hard to pay attention to the signs\nWithout you, feel like slowly, I&#39;m dying\nBroken hearts can make a grown man cry\n

trying to have a nice night, though\nWaiter brought the check for the meal\nShe said, &quot;Babe, I think there was a typo&quot;\n\nNah girl, I got it, that&#39;s light though\nI can show you bigger things than that\nIt&#39;s gon&#39; be a minute &#39;til I&#39;m back\nLet me get your images, they last\nAMEX had a limit in the past\nI had plenty women in the past\nI done plenty sinnin&#39; in the past\nYou don&#39;t need to know, but you can ask\n\nStickin&#39; on your backstage pass\nAll access, cause you bad\nYou can go wherever with that ass\nShow, to the shower, to the truck\nTruck, to the club, for the party\nYou go in first with your girls\n&#39;Cause I don&#39;t know who&#39;s out there watching\n\nBut I do know one thing though\nWomen, they come, they go\nSaturday, through Sunday, Monday\nMonday, Sunday, yo\nMaybe I&#39;ll love you one day\nMaybe we&#39;ll someday grow\n&#39;Til then I&#39;ll sit my drunk ass on that runway\nOn this one way\n\nTwo thirty baby, won&#39;t you meet me by The Bean?\nToo early, maybe later you can show me things\nYou know what it is, whenever I visit\nWindy city, she blowing me kisses, no\nThirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight\nWill
