Using Andrew @mcca02 Mallet software, I will conduct some topic analysis on several country songs from Billboard's Top100 March 13, 2020.



```{r}
library(ggrepel)
```

```{r}
library(gridExtra)
data(mtcars)
library(ggplot2)
setwd("~/mallet/")
keys <- read.csv("Rap_keys1.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
Edges <- read.csv("Edges.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
all <- merge(keys, Edges, by = "Topics")

ggplot(all, aes(Topics, Order)) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  geom_text_repel(data = subset(all, Order > 0.04),
 segment.size = 0.15,
segment.alpha = 1.0,
aes(
color = factor(Topics),
label = Words,
))
```

Seems to get 68% of its words from topic number 27, 20% from topic number 18, 5% from topic 17 and 8% from topic 39. Anything less than 5% I chose not to show.

keys1 <- read.csv("Country_keys.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
Edges1 <- read.csv("Country_word_topics.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
all1 <- merge(x = keys1, y = Edges1, by = "Topic")

ggplot(all1, aes(Topic, Order)) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  geom_text_repel(data = subset(all1, Order > 0.04),
 segment.size = 0.15,
segment.alpha = 1.0,
aes(
color = factor(Topic),
label = Words,
))
```
