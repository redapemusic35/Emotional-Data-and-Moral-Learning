<p>In her book “Wandering in
Darkness,” Eleonore <span class="citation">Stump (2010)</span> argues that
narrative can be a source of knowledge. The elevator speech of this view, is that narrative is a kind of moral testimony which communicates moral knowledge. This is because unlike standard moral testimony, narratives communicate not only emotions the character feels in a given situation, but also provides a sort of framework as to what emotions the audience may experience in a similar situation. On this presupposition, I will attempt to use natural language processing and data mining to explore methods in which we might find sources of moral knowledge and sources which may undermine moral knowledge.</p>
