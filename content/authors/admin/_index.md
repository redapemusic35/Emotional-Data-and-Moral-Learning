In her book “Wandering in
Darkness,” Eleonore Stump (2010) argues that
narrative can be a source of knowledge.
However, it is not immediately clear to me
just how this might work. One intuition is
that narrative can be thought of as a kind of
testimony which relies on more than just our
cognitive faculties, but our conative ones as
well. Looking at literature in the philosophy
of music, particularly at the phenomenons of
emotional expression and contagion, I believe
that a case can be made which shows just how
this might work, that narratives are a source
of knowledge.

In 2012, Facebook conducted a study [@kram14a] to determine whether emotions are contagious on social networks. Using a sample size of 689,003 of it's own users, Facebook manipulated the extent to which the study participants were exposed to the expressions of emotion. By reducing posts with positive emotional content, or with negative emotional content based on the user's User ID, Facebook determined that emotional contagion, the spread of human emotions, can occur through social networks as it can in face to face interactions [@hatf93a]. The more positive emotional content in a user's feed indicated that the user would themself become more positive; they would themselves post more positive content. Similarly, if that user had more negative content in their feed, they themselves would then express more negative emotions; their posts would then contain more negative emotional content.

As parents, we constantly worry about what effects physical and social environments will have on our children. We feel that these environments are affective for our child's understanding of their own self-worth, their confidence at achieving those goals that are important for a flourishing life. We worry about the people that they will meet everyday. We worry about our children's teachers and school administrators, their friends, neighbors etc. We worry that these environmental factors will conspire to destroy our child's understanding of self, that they will convince her that her hard work will not be rewarded, that the underlying society our community is founded on is necessarily inimical to her self flourishing. We worry about the emotional contents of those interactions, communications with teachers, friends, etc., and what their effects will be on her.

What stands out here, is the suggestion that a person’s earliest moral views are inherited from her social environment. What might be said that their social environment consists of? Is it too fast to say that one’s earliest social environments consist of cartoons, news, early childhood literature (children's books)?

The Facebook study suggests that researchers are able to discover emotional content in the communications between users of their platform, and further that this emotional content is contagious. If this is accurate, then I think that there is reason to worry about the moral and emotional content of large data sets, for instance, music playing on the radio or streaming across a Spotify station and the emotional content and consequences these may have on a population. 

Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count Software, LIWC (the software used by the Facebook researchers), I would like to determine to what extent the emotional content of data sets can be quantified. As such, I would like to explore the possibilities of using LIWC, to determine the moral content prevalent in large quantities of data, such as forms of narrative (e.g. music lyrics). In doing so, I hope to facilitate the efforts in which concerned individuals (e.g. parents and lawmakers etc.) may perform a scan of a large data set (e.g. lyrics for country songs recorded in the 1970s), and discover prevalent moral themes. 

I recognize that this is maybe not strictly a philosophical project. However, I believe that the majority of the work that I believe is related to this project is philosophical. I do not necessarily intend that I perform a psychological study, rather, I would like to put forth a case wherein I defend the prospects and ethics of such a study.

Therefore, I would like to highlight two primary goals of a potential project such as this: first, articulate the extent to which epistemologists think that moral knowledge can be transmitted through narrative. Some moralists have begun exploring the extent to which morality, thought of as a kind of knowledge, is transmitted and shared from individual to individual and within groups. Often times, testimony is thought of as a conduit for the transmission of typical as well as moral knowledge and narrative is thought of as a form of testimony in many cases. There are many types and methods of narrative. A common one, is that of music, but there are many many more thought we should seek to understand more for its importance in the insemination of moral knowledge.

One of my aims is to articulate a project by which one may come to have an understanding supported by empirical data, what sorts of moral values are promoted in various subcultures within the United States by analyzing viewing and listening habits of specific populations. One could create a map, if possible, of our moral landscape, as a form of moral education instituted by popular culture, to develop a method in which to attempt to understand dominantly held values, and those being communicated to a younger generation.

Additionally, it would be useful to write a computer script which performs a search of the internet for the various forms of narrative in contemporary culture and where these are most prevalent (Otter.ai is a new mobile application that seems promising for recording movie dialog). Finally, I would like to use LIWC to determine the general moral content in these forms of narrative under McGrath's principle that  “[a]ny source of ordinary empirical knowledge is also a potential source of moral knowledge, and any threat to our ordinary empirical knowledge (or ability to acquire such knowledge in the first place) is also a threat in the moral domain.”[@mcgr19a, 2]
