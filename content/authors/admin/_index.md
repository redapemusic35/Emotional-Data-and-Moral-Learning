In her book “Wandering in
Darkness,” Eleonore @stum10 argues that
narrative can be a source of knowledge.
However, it is not immediately clear to me
just how this might work. One intuition is
that narrative can be thought of as a kind of
testimony which relies on more than just our
cognitive faculties, but our conative ones as
well. Looking at literature in the philosophy
of music, particularly at the phenomenons of
emotional expression and contagion, I believe
that a case can be made which shows just how
this might work, that narratives are a source
of knowledge. I begin by developing what
I believe to be the best version of Stump’s
argument. I then explain conation and the
importance of it in moral motivation. In the
remainder of the paper, I look at various
aspects of emotional expression and the
accompanying phenomenon of emotional contagion
in the philosophy of music. Relying on these
two important concepts, I argue that these
should provide an important way for us to
understand how narratives may provide some
kind of moral instruction not available to us
by moral testimony alone. I conclude by
arguing that what Stump calls 'Fransican
knowledge', is merely that which is developed
via our conative faculties.
