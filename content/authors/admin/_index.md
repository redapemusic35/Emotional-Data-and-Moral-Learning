Philosophers have argued in favor of narrative as a source for moral knowledge. Assuming that music may represent a kind of narrative, what means are available to us which might help us understand what kinds of moral knowledge is represented by various popular music styles.

In her book “Wandering in
Darkness,” Eleonore Stump (2010) argues that
narrative can be a source of knowledge.
However, it is not immediately clear to me
just how this might work. One intuition that I have is
that narrative can be thought of as a kind of
testimony which relies on more than just our
cognitive faculties, but our conative ones as
well. For me, this sounds awfully similar to how music might be described. Therefore, looking at literature in the philosophy
of music, particularly at the phenomenons of
emotional expression and contagion, I believe
that a case can be made which shows just how
this might work, that narratives are a source
of knowledge.

There are three methods which I think can be useful in this regard:

1. Natural Language Processing
2. Topic Modeling
3. Sentiment Analysis

Ultimately, I do not think that I will have reached any definitive conclusions regarding moral sources and music lyrics. What I hope to have done however, is offer some reflections on how we might use big data to determine moral knowledge sources.
