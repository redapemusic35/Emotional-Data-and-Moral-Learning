<p>This is one of the more taxing portions of the project. However, I believe that it is the most illuminating in a project of this type. First, one of the concerns I had with attempting to find moral knowledge among song lyrics, I was worried that the temptation would be to count the overall negative and positive words among a song’s lyrics.</p>
<p>For instance, among some of my earlier attempts, I noticed that a song’s lyrics might include many terms which I thought were quite negative, such as song’s about murder and prison sentences. However, Stanford’s Core NLP sometimes attributed positive scores to these examples. I was perplexed, thinking that either I ran the program wrong, or that the program was exhibiting a potential fault. I don’t think that this is the case anymore, but rather that I was looking at the lyrics and understanding the content in terms of weights of various terms, rather than attempting to understand their context.</p>
<p>This I think leads us to one of the primary benefits that sentiment analysis affords us. Essentially, sentiment analysis understands how terms are used in the context of the data set.</p>
<p>I am not sure how exactly, but here is a link that examples some of the differences among <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/StanfordCoreNlp2014.pdf">sentiment analysis methods</a>.</p>
<p>In this portion, I will only focus on three sets of examples, “The Bones” by Maren Morris, “Homesick” by Kane Brown, and a random example passage for comparison’s sake.</p>
<p>First, the lyrics to “The Bones.”</p>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
##  [1] &quot;We are in the homestretch of the hard times.&quot;                                                              
##  [2] &quot;We took a hard left, but we are alright.&quot;                                                                  
##  [3] &quot;Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but We built this right, so nothing is ever gonna move it.&quot;
##  [4] &quot;When the bones are good, the rest does not matter.&quot;                                                        
##  [5] &quot;Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter.&quot;                                                      
##  [6] &quot;Let it rain because you and I remain the same.&quot;                                                            
##  [7] &quot;When there is not a crack in the foundation.&quot;                                                              
##  [8] &quot;Baby, I know any storm we are facing Will blow right over while we stay put.&quot;                              
##  [9] &quot;The house does not fall when the bones are good.&quot;                                                          
## [10] &quot;Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I cannot even mess it up, although we both try.&quot;                      
## [11] &quot;No, it does not always go the way we planned it.&quot;                                                          
## [12] &quot;But the wolves came and went and we are still standing.&quot;                                                   
## [13] &quot;When the bones are good, the rest does not matter.&quot;                                                        
## [14] &quot;Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter.&quot;                                                      
## [15] &quot;Let it rain because you and I remain the same.&quot;                                                            
## [16] &quot;When there ain not a crack in the foundation.&quot;                                                             
## [17] &quot;Baby, I know any storm we are facing.&quot;                                                                     
## [18] &quot;Will blow right over while we stay put.&quot;                                                                   
## [19] &quot;The house does not fall when the bones are good.&quot;                                                          
## [20] &quot;When the bones are good.&quot;                                                                                  
## [21] &quot;Bones are good, the rest, the rest does not matter baby, it does not really matter.&quot;                       
## [22] &quot;Paint could peel, the glass could shatter oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter.&quot;                     
## [23] &quot;Bones are good, the rest, the rest does not matter ooh.&quot;                                                   
## [24] &quot;Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter yeah.&quot;                                                
## [25] &quot;When the bones are good, the rest does not matter.&quot;                                                        
## [26] &quot;Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter.&quot;                                                      
## [27] &quot;Let it rain let it rain, let it rain because you and I remain the same woo.&quot;                               
## [28] &quot;When there ain not a crack in the foundation woo.&quot;                                                         
## [29] &quot;Baby, I know any storm we are facing.&quot;                                                                     
## [30] &quot;Will blow right over while we stay put.&quot;

## [32] &quot;Yeah, ooh.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Next, the lyrics to “Homesick.” In this set, I had to fix a lot of contractions, words like “I’m” and “ain’t” and “we’ll.” You might notice that some of the lyrics seem a bit off, this is why.</p>
<pre><code>##       [,1]

<p>Finally, my example text. Disclosure, the code used on this page, as well as the example below I adopted from Matthew <span class="citation">Jockers (2017)</span>’s excellent introduction to the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/syuzhet/vignettes/syuzhet-vignette.html">Syuzhet package for R</a>.</p>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;I begin this story with a neutral statement.&quot;                                
##  [2] &quot;Basically this is a very silly test.&quot;                                        
##  [3] &quot;You are testing the Syuzhet package using short, inane sentences.&quot;           
##  [4] &quot;I am actually very happy today.&quot;                                             
##  [5] &quot;I have finally finished writing this package.&quot;                               
##  [6] &quot;Tomorrow I will be very sad.&quot;                                                
##  [7] &quot;I won&#39;t have anything left to do.&quot;                                           
##  [8] &quot;I might get angry and decide to do something horrible.&quot;                      
##  [9] &quot;I might destroy the entire package and start from scratch.&quot;                  
## [10] &quot;Then again, I might find it satisfying to have completed my first R package.&quot;
## [11] &quot;Honestly this use of the Fourier transformation is really quite elegant.&quot;    
## [12] &quot;You might even say it&#39;s beautiful!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>I next get the song sentiments and do provide some lists which show the sentences which are joyful and those expressing anger. What is great about “nrc” is that I could display those sentences expressing anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust.</p>
