\subsubsection{The Thought Experiment}\label{the-thought-experiment}}

One of the books that I have been working my way through, is a
collection of papers on the phenomenon of empathy (Coplan 2011). The
collection of papers all seek to articulate the phenomenon of empathy as
a means of ``mind reading,'' meaning that empathy helps us to understand
or to predict what another might do. Empathy ``has been seen as
important in relation to our capacity to gain a grasp of the content of
other people's minds, and to predict and explain what they will think,
feel, and do'' (Coplan 2011, ix). Further, empathy has been seen as
important for our ethical relations with one another: ``in relation to
our capacity to respond to others ethically---enabling us not only to
gain a grasp of the other's suffering, but also to respond in an
ethically appropriate way'' {[}ix{]}.

I have attempted to argue elsewhere in this project, that Stump (2010)
has a similar treatment of mind reading according to which she argues
that narratives provide a way to have what she calls ``second personal
knowledge'' which is a kind of \emph{knowledge by acquaintance}. If
Coplan is right, then using this understanding of second personal
knowledge, knowledge of a person by acquaintance, as it might be
facilitated by narrative, it might be thought that narrative is a
vehicle through which we can come to know others second personally, we
come to know what they feel and predict what they may do as a result
because of a narratives capacity to induce empathy. Narratives provide a
way in which we might come to know others empathically.

There are two ways in which I might be acquainted with another; the
first is that I might know certain facts about that person. That they
like strawberry flavored ice cream, ride a bike to class 3 days a week,
and have never been outside of the country. However, there is another
way in which I can come to know a person, and this is through
acquaintance, second personally. Further, it seems as though this kind
of knowledge can only be had through acquaintance, and that narratives
can provide a vehicle by which this acquaintance happens. As such,
narratives help us to know others second personally by acquainting us
with that person.

Why is all of this important? Well, in Coplan (2011)'s book, NoÃ«l
Carroll (2010) writes about the emotive responses of audiences to
fictional characters in narratives. He outlines a number of ways in
which the emotions of the audiences either converge, are congruent with,
or resonate with those of the characters (Carroll 2010, 162).

Here are some relationships between characters and their audiences which
he examines:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Coincidentally occurring emotions; emotions coincidentally occurring
  simultaneously. This includes:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the antipathy element of solidarity, simultaneously expressing anger
    or outrage towards some event or circumstance.
  \item
    Vectrially converging emotions---these can encompass certain
    episodes of sympathetic feeling; expressing sympathy towards or for
    another.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Mirror reflexes---affective states---these are not fully articulated
  emotions, but can contribute to their formation. They include merely
  expressing the same emotions as another, say what might occur in one's
  facial expressions which communicates that they understand the pain
  another shares in a conversation.
\end{enumerate}

Central to my emotional data project on a whole, is the idea that it is
possible that some types of music may disseminate moral knowledge while
others may undermine moral knowledge. To understand whether we might
have reason to accept this assertion, I first consider the way music
lyrics as narratives, acquaint us with the characters, or the perceived
characters that those lyrics are about. Second, we might wonder whether
these lyrics facilitate good relationships, in the current case we might
say ``induce empathy,'' assuming that moral knowledge has something to
say about what our relationships with others should be like. So to
understand how important relationships among people may be in country
music, I will run some topic analyses on billboard's country top 50 for
May 23, 2020.

Songs}\label{topic-analysis-on-countrys-top-songs}}

One particularly interesting aspect of this discussion is Carroll's idea
that sympathy for a character governs whether the audience will
empathize with that character (Carroll 2010, 174). In other words, in
order for an audience to empathize with a character, they most first be
able to sympathize with that character. Further, what determines whether
the audience will sympathize with a character, is whether the audience
is capable of having altruistic attitudes towards the characters in
question. In order to experience emotions of altruism, the audience
perceives them as morally good. However, sometimes what causes us to
determine whether someone is morally good, is that their interests align
with ours, or whether that person's interests align with those of her
community in a way in which our own would in a similar situation.
Carroll calls these kinds of factors factors of kinship, group
membership, group interests etc. We like people who get along well, and
care about those in their community who are good, and we resonate and
therefore sympathize with them.

After cleaning the data considerably, I have two frames of data each of
which consists of two columns. The first frame has 1,160 lines of data
while the second has 2,733. Each line in the first frame is a tokenized
version of all of the lyrics in either the country, first frame, or
hip-hop, second frame. A token is merely a word from a lyric while the
right column consists of the number of instances of that token in the
entire corpus whether hip-hop or country.

\begin{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}

##  1 yeah     526

\end{verbatim}

What I show here, are two distinct data frames. The first includes those
words which are used most frequently in the top 50 country songs of the
billboard country charts, taken May 23, 2020. Ignoring ``ai'' (which I
believe is a malformed version of the word ``ain't) which shows to have
been repeated 127 times in 50 sets of lyrics, the most frequent word
used in these lyrics is''love" at 107 usage instance in 50 song lyrics.
The next, ``yeah'' should likely be articulated as a \emph{stop-word} as
should ``ai.'' Stop-words are words like ``and,'' ``the,'' ``it,'' and
are typically not thought of as contributing to the content meaning in a
data source.

\includegraphics{Country-top-100_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Country-top-100_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-2.pdf}

What I find highly meaningful here, are the stark differences in those
words used in each set of data. For instance, while words like ``love,''
``hope,'' ``heart,'' make for the most used words in the country set,
more derogatory and disparaging language is used in the hip-hop set.

\hypertarget{more-comparisons}{%
\subsection{More Comparisons}\label{more-comparisons}}

Another way in which we might compare two sets of song lyrics in order
to determine their moral content, is by comparing the those words which
they use in common. What I mean by this, is that a way to compare the
language in two sets of data, is by comparing the frequency of which
they use the same words.

To do so, I will compare the language used in Jane Austen's ``Sense and
Sensibility,'' the Bronte Sister's ``Jane Eyre,'' ``Wuthering Heights,''
``The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,'' and ``Agnes Grey,'' and H.G. Well's
``The Time Machine,'' ``The War of the Worlds,'' ``The Invisible Man,''
and ``The Island of Doctor Moreau.''

Obviously the data sets built from the novels above are quite a bit
larger than those of the country and hip-hop data sets. However, the
algorithm I use, as I will show, does a very good job, nevertheless in
distinguishing between each of these. Yet, for other reasons, what
follows next may not be the best comparison made, i.e., we might
naturally expect differences in language in this way given that each of
these are written in different historical periods. Yet, as I will show,
it is still the case that the language used in the country set is more
similar to that used in each of the novels.

In the first frame, I have broken up Jane Austen's ``Sense and
Sensibility'' into lines. Each line constitutes an actual line as
printed in the Project Gutenberg version of the book. Next, in the
second frame, I have created a token from each word in the book and
counted the number of times that this token is used. For instance, you
will see that the word ``miss,'' is the most frequently used word at
1855 instances.

In the fourth frame, I count the number of instances of a particular
word in the H.G. Well's novels. You will see here that the word ``time''
occurs the most frequently at 454 instances. Finally, in the fifth
frame, the words ``time,'' and ``miss'' are the most frequently
occurring in the Bronte Sister's novels.

In the frame immediately following this one, I compare the Jane Austen
novels against the Bronte Sister's and H.G. Wells' novels. Those words
closest to the dotted line running though the middle of the frame are
those words with the most similarly usage frequency. I.e., the words
``miss'' and ``time'' have a similar usage frequency in the Jane Austen
and Bronte Sister's novels. It is likely that this is to be expected
given that the lives of Jane Austen and the Bronte Sisters
overlapped---though they wrote in different styles---while H.G. Wells
wrote in the late 19th and early 20th century (Robinson n.d.).
Additionally, those words further from the dotted line in the middle,
are words that found more in one text than in the other. Consequently,
looking at the Bronte Sisters, words like ``Elizabeth'' are found more
in Jane Austen novels than they are in novels written by the Bronte
Sisters. Looking at H.G. Wells, words like ``miss'' are found more in
Jane Austen novels than in H.G. Wells while words like ``smoke'' are
found more in H.G. Wells than in Jane Austen.

If Stump is right, or if I am right in representing her argument, one
way in which we can know someone, is by having the same, or similar
feelings as the person in response to the same object. However, for this
to happen, I question whether the language must be a shared language.

For instance, in the frame following this one, I make more comparisons
in the ways in which language is used between country, hip-hop, the
Bronte Sisters, Jane Austen and H.G. Wells.

One thing to notice about the above frame, and this is similar through
this post, is that those data sets which have more similar word usage
are typically noted by a denser plot while those with less similar word
usages are noted by more transparent plots. As such, looking at the
previous frame, we see that the Bronte Sisters have a more similar word
usage to Country music than does Hip-Hop.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

In one of my earlier posts, I stated that it seems that country music
uses more relationship words than hip-hop, and that positive emotional
sentiments are often expressed in the presence of relationships whereas
negative emotional sentiments are expressed when those relationships
become threatened. Conversely, it seems that the opposite is true in
many contemporary and popular hip-hop songs. Positive emotional
sentiments are expressed in context of objects rather than people
whereas negative emotional sentiments are expressed in terms of human
relationships. Although I have not shown the emotive correlations
between these sets of data, in other posts, for instance under the menu
heading ``Sentiment Analysis,'' I have. However, it would be important
to do so on these texts to see what kind of relationships, if any, there
are between those words used, and the emotive expressions which
accompany them.

Therefore, if we are to say that morality is about relationships between
people, then one way to possibly measure moral knowledge in a narrative,
would be to determine whether the narrative is about relationships, and
whether it expresses what we might think ought to be expressed in the
same or similar context.
