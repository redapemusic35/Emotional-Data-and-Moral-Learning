Philosophers have argued in favor of narrative as a source for moral knowledge. Assuming that music may represent a kind of narrative, what means are available to us which might help us understand what kinds of moral knowledge is represented by various popular music styles.

In her book “Wandering in Darkness,” Eleonore @stum10 argues that narrative
can be a source of knowledge. However, it is not immediately clear to me just
how this might work. One intuition is that narrative can be thought of as
a kind of testimony which relies on more than just our cognitive faculties,
but our conative ones as well. Looking at literature in the philosophy of
music, particularly at the phenomenons of emotional expression and contagion,
I believe that a case can be made which shows just how this might work, that
narratives are a source of knowledge. I begin by developing what I believe to
be the best version of Stump’s argument. I then explain conation and the
importance of it in moral motivation. In the remainder of the paper, I look
at various aspects of emotional expression and the accompanying phenomenon of
emotional contagion in the philosophy of music. Relying on these two
important concepts, I argue that these should provide an important way for us
to understand how narratives may provide some kind of moral instruction not
available to us by moral testimony alone. I conclude by arguing that what
Stump calls 'Fransican knowledge', is merely that which is developed via our
conative faculties.
